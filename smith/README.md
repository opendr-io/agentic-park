Smith is an autonomous agent pack that will process most alerts and anomaly detections generated by ODR (open DR, also in this GitHub org.)  ODR mainly looks for strange things happening in your AI dev tools at present but Smith will process most alerts generated by ODR.

Smith also processes raw event and alert data from the ODR (open DR) project in order to investigate alerts and anomaly detections. It outputs an analysis of each alert. It lets you know when it thinks it has a high confidence detection and engages you in a collaborative analysis conversation in order to work out whether the detected activity is benign and expected or unexpected and potentially malicious. 

Some sample alert data is provided so that it can do something out of the box. Sample event data is not provided due to its size, and the need to sanitize it, but can be generated by running openDR. It has a filter layer to try to stop prompt injections from reaching the agents and one filter test case alert is included in the sample data; you will see it get "intercepted" by the filter. 

Usage: install the modules in requirements.txt, populate a key in the .env file and run:

```python orchestrator.py```
