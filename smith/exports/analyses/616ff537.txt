## Analysis: Generic Non-PnP Monitor Driver

**What this is:**
This is a Windows Generic Non-PnP (Non-Plug and Play) Monitor driver - a standard Windows display driver used when the system cannot identify the specific monitor model or when using virtual/generic display adapters.

**Key Indicators - BENIGN:**

✅ **Signed by Microsoft Windows** - Legitimate Microsoft signature  
✅ **Standard Windows driver version** - 10.0.19041.5794 (Windows 10 build 19041)  
✅ **Properly signed** - is_signed: True  
✅ **Expected driver description** - "Generic Non-PnP Monitor" is a standard Windows component  
✅ **Standard device path** - DISPLAY\DEFAULT_MONITOR is the normal location for display drivers  
✅ **No suspicious installation activity** - No pnputil, driver installation tools, or malicious processes detected

**Context from Event Stream:**
- The system is running security monitoring scripts (Python-based driver monitoring via PowerShell)
- A PowerShell query for driver information occurred 1 second before this alert (14:16:49)
- The monitoring script likely **detected** this driver, not installed it
- This appears to be a pre-existing driver that was enumerated by the monitoring system

**Assessment:**
This is a **legitimate Windows display driver** that is part of the standard Windows installation. The "Generic Non-PnP Monitor" driver is commonly used for:
- Virtual machines
- Remote desktop sessions
- Systems where the specific monitor model isn't detected
- Default display configurations

The timing correlation with the driver monitoring script suggests this driver was already present and was simply enumerated by the security monitoring system running on the host.

**SEVERITY: LOW**

This is expected Windows system behavior. No action required unless you recently changed display hardware or are experiencing display issues.
