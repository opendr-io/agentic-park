## Analysis: Generic Non-PnP Monitor Driver

**What this is:**
This is a Windows Generic Non-PnP Monitor driver, a standard display driver component used by Windows when a specific monitor driver is not available or when using generic display configurations.

**Driver Details:**
- **Signed by:** Microsoft Windows (legitimate signature)
- **Version:** 10.0.19041.5794 (Windows 10 build 19041 - version 2004/20H1)
- **Signed:** Yes (verified Microsoft signature)
- **Device ID:** DISPLAY\DEFAULT_MONITOR\4&427137E&0&UID0 (standard display device path)

**Context from Event Stream:**
The driver installation occurred during a **scheduled Windows maintenance window** that began at 12:05:15, approximately 4 minutes before the alert:

1. **DismHost.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) was launched at 12:05:25 by `cleanmgr.exe` - this is the Windows component responsible for driver installation and system servicing
2. Multiple Windows Update services were active (wuauserv, WaaSMedicSvc, BITS)
3. Standard maintenance tasks were running: Disk Cleanup, Defragmentation, Windows Defender maintenance
4. Volume Shadow Copy Service started at 12:07:04 (typical before system changes)

**Assessment:**
This is **legitimate Windows maintenance activity**. The Generic Non-PnP Monitor driver is a standard Microsoft-signed component that was installed as part of automated Windows Update/maintenance operations. The timing, process tree (cleanmgr.exe → DismHost.exe), and all surrounding activity are consistent with normal Windows servicing behavior.

**Indicators of Legitimacy:**
✓ Valid Microsoft signature  
✓ Standard Windows driver version  
✓ Installed via legitimate Windows servicing (DismHost.exe)  
✓ Part of scheduled maintenance window  
✓ No suspicious process or network activity  

**SEVERITY: LOW**

This is expected system behavior - Windows was updating/installing display drivers during scheduled maintenance. No action required.
